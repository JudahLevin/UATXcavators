# üìù UATX TBM Meeting ‚Äì May 21, 2025

## Attendees
- Judah Levin
- Eitan, Kellen, Christian, Max, Sam

## Design Notes

### Cutter Head Excavation and Muck Removal System

- In the **center of the cutter head**, an **auger** is installed.
  - The auger lies within a **secondary tubing** system.
  - This tubing allows **mud and fine particles to fall through** while trapping **larger rocks**.

- Around the cutter head, within the TBM shell, there's a **domed collection chamber**:
  - Acts as a **filter**: only **mud and smaller particles** pass through.
  - **Larger rocks** remain outside the filter region.

- The **domed chamber**:
  - **Slopes downward toward the center**, encouraging gravity-driven muck movement.
  - Is connected to **vacuum tubes** to remove mud efficiently.

- An **oppositely spinning ring** on the cutter head:
  - Functions as a **grinder**, reducing rock size and minimizing clogging risks.
  - Aims to increase throughput by producing finer particles suitable for vacuum or auger capture.

## Action Items
- [ ] CAD sketch of auger and domed chamber layout
- [ ] Simulate rock/mud separation using filter slope geometry
- [ ] Estimate vacuum pressure and auger speed requirements

## Next Meeting
**Date:** 6-4-25 
**Agenda:** Review CAD, finalize excavation subsystem interface with structural frame

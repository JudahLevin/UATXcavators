## üß™ 3. Planned Subassembly Tests

| Test                     | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cutterhead Spin Test** | Vary RPM; record voltage/current                                                              |
| **Auger Throughput**     | Use in PVC; measure vertical soil movement, volume/time, jamming                              |
| **Vacuum Flow**          | Simulate with rocks/cloth; measure debris clearance                                           |
| **Frame Load**           | Add symmetric/asymmetric weights; measure with dial gauge; simulate thrust via hydraulic jack |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Design Concepts & Engineering Notes

* **Current Design**:

  * Central auger within tube, bearing-mounted, connected to cutterhead
  * Vacuum tubes on top to collect loosened soil
* **Alternative Concept**:

  * Remove auger and tube to simplify and improve cutterhead performance
  * Rely solely on water conditioning and vacuum extraction
  * Risks: vacuum tube reliability
* **Fabrication Shop Identified**:

  * Austin-based with:

    * Fiber laser cutting (for curves)
    * Break forming
    * CNC routing

---

## üõ† 5. Procurement & Tools

* Oil barrel: Possible option for prototyping, sourced locally (e.g., Bastrop scrap)
* Better alternative: sheet metal cut and formed by partner shop
* Assembly memberships for access to welding, basic fabrication tools
* Goal: Crowdsource tools from team/UATX community

---

## üìÜ 6. Timeline & Work Plan

* **Design Freeze**: Nov 21, 2025
* **Testing**: Winter break through March
* **Summer**:

  * Judah working full-time
  * Others welcome to assist on design/CAD
  * Weekly or bi-weekly check-ins encouraged

---

## üì¶ 7. Logistics

* Transportation: Local advantage, 30 miles to Bastrop
* Options: U-Hauls, personal vehicles

---

## ü¶∫ 8. Safety & Team Policy

* **Lockout Tagout**: Kits must be procured and used
* **Documentation**: All team members should read the full competition rules
* **Team Culture**:

  * Prioritize safety and accountability
  * Communicate clearly, meet regularly

---

## ‚úÖ 9. Next Steps

* Finalize and submit TOP briefing by **June 16**
* Improve CAD design, particularly cutterhead drive integration
* Source fabrication quotes and membership tools
* Begin internal tool inventory
* Prepare for upcoming testing milestones

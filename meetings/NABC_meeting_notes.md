# 🛠️ NABC Mini Competition Team Meeting Notes

**Date:** _(not specified)_  
**Duration:** ~33 min  
**Topic:** Project overview, CAD design, safety training, deliverables, and funding

## 📹 Safety Training: Lockout/Tagout (LOTO)

- **Purpose:** Mandatory training per The Boring Company (TBC) safety guidelines.
- **Takeaways:**
  - Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) controls hazardous energy during maintenance.
  - Tags must include: date, operator name, and additional TBC-specified fields.
- **Action Item:** All team members must watch the [LOTO Training Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5CWnUFsevo).

## 🧰 CAD Design Overview

- **Concept:** Vertical TBM with auger-based muck removal system.
- **Key Features:**
  - Central auger (6-inch radius, ~0.7m tall).
  - Cutterhead at base with vacuum tubes (optional).
  - Dirt collected in chamber and lifted by auger.
  - Top platform design in progress to offload dirt for vacuum or gravity removal.
- **Open Issues:**
  - Deciding whether vacuum tubes are necessary.
  - Resolving motor placement conflict between auger and cutterhead.
  - Exploring options for dome-based muck redirection to external vacuums.

## 1. ✅ Quick Recap (5 min)

- Highlights from last meeting:
  - LOTO training requirement discussed
  - CAD model version 1 presented
  - Initial cost estimates reviewed
  - NABC rules document overviewed
  - Deliverables timeline outlined

## 3. 🏗️ CAD Model Iteration (10 min)

- Review updates:
  - Top muck redirection dome
  - Cutterhead support structure
- Assign next edits:
  - Add motor-to-cutterhead linkage
  - Update vacuum layout if dome system is adopted

---

## 4. 💵 Budget & Procurement Review (5 min)

- Review current draft budget (vacuum, auger, steel, motor, tools)
- Confirm who is:
  - Sourcing pricing for oil barrel and steel
  - Contacting Assembly about flexible memberships
- Align budget with upcoming funding pitch (Philip Greenwald, Dean Ruth)

| 2     | Funding breakdown and gap plan |
| 3     | Logistics: transport and tool access |
| 4     | Timeline: design freeze, testing, shipping |
| 5     | Design overview and comparison (vacuum vs. no-vacuum, auger layouts, etc.) |

**Assignments:**
- Draft owner for each slide
- Owner for team member roster and metadata
- CAD render exporter for presentation

## 6. 📜 Team Policy & Ground Rules Review (10 min)

**Purpose:** Establish shared expectations for professional conduct, safety, and team accountability.

- **Safety Compliance:**
  - Lockout/Tagout procedures must be followed at all times.
  - Emergency stop design and placement will be reviewed in every hardware milestone.

- **Design & Build Protocol:**
  - All subsystems must be documented in GitHub folders.
  - Proof testing must be logged and tagged per NABC spec.
  - Every component should include FEA or first-principles safety validation before build.

- **Testing & Maintenance:**
  - No testing may occur without prior check-in and approval.
  - Must log test parameters, failures, and fixes.

- **Funding & Procurement:**
  - All purchases must be approved by finance lead.
  - Donation plans (e.g., tools to UATX) should be documented in budget notes.

- **Conduct & Collaboration:**
  - Weekly summer check-in attendance expected.
  - Shared respect for each member’s time and work — clear async updates via GitHub or shared doc.

**Action Item:**  
Finalize and post written version of Team Policy on GitHub.

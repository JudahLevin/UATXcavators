# UATXcavators Plans December - March

The problem: we need to build a functional tunnel boring machine by the end of March 2026.

## Needs
* Compute mechanical load justifications for TBM design
* Complete **CAD**
* Design detailed electrical **schematics**
* Purchase electrical equipment* (e.g. breakers, contactors)
* Purchase the **cutterhead motor and gearbox**
* Purchase the **screw jack**
* Set up **hydrovac truck rental** for competition week
* Purchase **steel**
* **Fabricate** our in-house steel parts

## Order of operations Dec 21 - Jan 5
1. JUDAH - MECHANICAL: Source and buy the motor/gearbox and screw jack because of lead time
    1. Complete and justify TBM diameter + cutterhead design for torque/RPM and thrust/stroke length computation
    2. Refine the technical spec mathematical results with literature
    3. Justify torque/RPM and thrust specs of each w/ Cole (for solidifying the design and avoiding expensive mistakes)
    4. Select a compatible VFD for the cutterhead motor
    5. Motor/gearbox note: search motor by horsepower, gearbox by output torque and reduction, both by NEMA/IEC size
    6. Find multiple product options for each online, diversify across different Austin distributors (for lead time and purchase failure margin of safety)
    7. Call the distributors and pay for fastest delivery (time is more important than money)
2. EITAN/SAM - ELECTRICAL: Design and purchase the electrical system/parts 
    1. Make a readable and clear diagram that interconnects all our power sources, actuators, sensors, and controls. We want to visualize the setup so we can detect missing parts. 
    2. Present the diagram to Cole and work with him to finalize it. 
    3. Once diagram is finalized, write up a complete BOM of cables, electronics, power equipment, sensors, and controls parts we need. Optimize for delivery speed.
    5. Purchase everything electrical on the BOM.
    6. Determine LOTO and safety equipment required and add to the BOM.
    7. Purchase everything for safety on the BOM.
3. JUDAH - MECHANICAL:
    1. Compute load rating ranges and run FEA analysis on TBM and launch frame structure based on our sourced cutterhead gearmotor and screw jack dimensions and forces.
    2. Get steel, bolt, and D-ring dimensions and design for both operation and mounting/transportation. Then, justify w/ Cole.
    3. Implement all designs and dimensions in fully assembled TBM CAD. This is our optimal design which acts as the basis for the TBM we actually build, given raw material supply and machining limitations.
    4. Visit local machine and steel shops (so we can get fast delivery/feedback cycles) and meet with experts to change the design given practical manufacturing factors: *record* steel size availability, equipment cost/access, and machining costs/time. Make tolerance compromises and structural substitutions (which are close to the optimal CAD).
    5. Write a BOM including all steel and bolt parts and machining needs.
    6. Purchase the BOM.
    8. Source equipment, location options required for assembly, as well as possible transportation methods (call local towing companies).
    9. Write up building and logistic plans and timelines.

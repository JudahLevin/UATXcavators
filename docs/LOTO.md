---

## 📌 Purpose

The Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedure ensures the **safe shutdown and maintenance** of the TBM and its subsystems by:

- Preventing accidental energization of electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems
- Providing clear visual indicators of locked systems
- Assigning responsibility and traceability for all lockouts

---

## 🧰 When to Use LOTO

LOTO must be used **whenever any team member will physically interact with the TBM**, particularly during:

- Maintenance or repairs
- Subsystem testing
- Handling energized components (motors, cylinders, pressure vessels)

---

## 🧱 Required Equipment

- Lockout padlocks (1 per person)
- Lockout hasps (for shared access)
- Tagout labels with name, date, reason
- Valve/plug lockouts for electrical and fluid components
- Safety key lockbox (optional)

---

## 🚦 LOTO Procedure

### 1. **Prepare for Shutdown**
   - Notify all team members
   - Identify all energy sources (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical)

### 2. **Shutdown Equipment**
   - Power down the TBM from the main operator station
   - Switch off and disconnect energy sources

### 3. **Isolate Energy**
   - Close valves, open breakers, unplug power cables
   - Discharge stored energy (capacitors, pressure tanks)

### 4. **Apply Lockout Devices**
   - Lock energy isolation devices in the “off” position
   - Each person working on the system applies their **own padlock**
   - Affix **tag** with name, contact, and date

### 5. **Verify Isolation**
   - Attempt a controlled restart to confirm zero energy
   - Check that actuators, motors, and valves are inoperable

### 6. **Perform Work**
   - Only after all verifications are complete

### 7. **Release from Lockout**
   - Remove tools and reassemble system
   - Each person removes their own lock
   - Restore power **only after all locks are removed**

---

## 👥 Responsibilities

- **Each worker** must place and remove their **own** lock and tag
- **LOTO Coordinator** (typically a subsystem lead) is responsible for:
  - Confirming LOTO before work begins
  - Tracking tagout status during integration

---

## 📋 UATX Team Policy

- All TBM systems require LOTO before internal work begins
- Lockout stations will be mounted near the Operator Station
- LOTO training is mandatory before equipment handling
- Non-compliance will result in immediate suspension from physical testing

[Timken Thrust Bearing Catalog](https://catalog.timken.com/Thrust-Bearing-Catalog/18/)

* *Cageless* allows for more load capacity at lower speed since the densely packed rollers increase friction
* *Tapered bearings* are best suited to withstand the shocks or vibrations that will cause radial misalignment. We expect some radial load due to cutting imbalances and moments, as well as ground resistance.
* *Double-acting bearings* handle bidirectional loads for extending the linear actuator and retracting it while carrying the TBM weight.
* Type TTD bearings are double-acting thrust tapered roller bearings
* Angular contact bearings are better suited to radial loads than thrust spherical roller bearings (e.g., tapered, barrel ones) because they don't slide off the raceway but are held in place by angled, flat faces. To calculate the Dynamic Equivalent Thrust Load ($P_a$), the multiplier for radial load ($F_r$) is 1.2 for dynamic spherical (2.7 for static) and .76 for angular contact (p. 20), indicating that the spherical type is more sensitive to radial, dynamically and statically. Also, the axial load ($F_a$) is equally sensitive in both cases. 
* P_a determines the life of the bearing
* Clay is soft and ductile, which can cause lubrication and sealing problems, though fewer mechanical issues.
* Rock is hard and brittle, which is more damaging than clay, particularly mechanically, as it can be both ductile and brittle.
* Significantly more misalignment tolerance in thrust ball bearings than any other type
* DTVL is bidirectional angular contact (mounting on p. 36)
* Worst case speed: 30 RPM or 3.14 rad/s. The heat generation and energy loss due to the bearing are a result of the operation speed, thrust load, lubrication viscosity, and bearing geometry/torque factors.
* *Grease* can act as a sealant, not oil, which is necessary for blocking muck, and better for low-speed applications. Aluminum and Calcium sulfonate greases have the most excellent resistance to water ingress. We want to choose a grease that will resist abrasive particles and water to reduce wear. Timken Construction and Off-Highway Grease, for instance, is meant for dirty environments (p. 60).
* Only for low-speed applications can the entire housing be filled with grease to protect against moisture and contaminants.
* The smallest angular contact TVL has 11.6 in OD, thrust cylindrical roller 6 in, tapered roller has 4 in ID, but the DTBL (double-acting) is too wide.

### Conditioning
- Read all relevant NABC rules:  
  - Sec 6 (pp. 18-19)  
- Plan Conditioning Test  
- Make a BOM (include logistical expenses) for test 1 so we can order now, and so the electrical team can plan cabling  
- White-box the items for test 1.  
- Determine the specs/design of and where to source the following. Prove each one with supporting calculations:  
  - Ultrasound emitters  
  - Spray nozzles  
  - Muck transport system: auger vs. conveyor vs. pump.  
- **By Monday, October 13th:** make a state diagram  

---

### Electrical
- Read all relevant NABC rules:  
  - Sec 7 (pp. 19-21)  
- Determine electrical low and high alarms for the IO list  
- Collaborate with the MMC subTeam to plan wiring and cabling for the Conditioning Test and Forces Test. Append electrical parts to their respective BOMs.  

---

### Software
- Read all relevant NABC rules:  
  - Sec 8, 9, 10 (pp. 21-25)  
- Code up controls logic for test 1 using an FPGA and a GUI to control a solenoid valve and pump  
- **By Monday, October 13th:** write an NABC-compliant IO list with Electrical’s & MMC’s alarm values  

---

### Mechanical & Mucking
- Read all relevant NABC rules:  
  - pp. 14  
- Plan Cutter Head Test and Forces Test, and put together a BOM.  
- Review muck disposal with Jack.  
- Determine hydraulics vs electric. Determine multiple motors vs one motor.  
- Determine where to place sensors  
- Review simulations and designs based on TBC, AECOM, and Alex’s advice  
- Record low and high alarm values for all mechanical sensor values.  
- Source a screw jack and a jack motor  
- Source metal and fab shops
